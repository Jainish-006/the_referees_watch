# CV_Football_Project

The main file for our code is Final_Code.ipynb. Running it may require installing packages. Running this code can be done by just running each block down the line. Several of these are commented out completely because they are older versions of our methods. It will output a video in the 'out' folder it should create that shows each of our methods except field number detection all in one video. 

The rest of the files are a mix of necessary files, auxiliary pytohn scripts, and output examples. 

The examples directory contains example videos of the output.
